# Advanced Calculator using Atmega32
#### This is an embedded systems project that uses an Atmega32 microcontroller to create an advanced calculator. The Atmega32 is a powerful microcontroller with a wide range of peripherals and features, making it a popular choice for embedded systems projects.

#### The project utilizes a keypad and a 16x2 character LCD screen to enable the user to input and display the numbers and results. The calculator can perform 3 mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on 4 numbers, where each number is two digits.

#### One of the key aspects of the project is the ability to handle and process multiple digits numbers, as well as the ability to perform multiple mathematical operations. The project also demonstrates the ability to program the microcontroller to interpret the keypad inputs and perform the corresponding calculations.

### Additionally, the project has a video demonstration and explanation that can be found on the provided link which demonstrates the functionality and usage of the calculator, and also the user interface design.
